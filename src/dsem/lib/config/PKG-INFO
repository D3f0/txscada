Description: This module allows a hierarchical configuration scheme with support for mappings
        and sequences, cross-references between one part of the configuration and
        another, the ability to flexibly access real Python objects without full-blown
        eval(), an include facility, simple expression evaluation and the ability to
        change, save, cascade and merge configurations. Interfaces easily with
        environment variables and command-line options. It has been developed on python
        2.3 but should work on version 2.2 or greater.
Platform: UNKNOWN
