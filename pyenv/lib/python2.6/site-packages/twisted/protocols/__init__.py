Twisted Protocols: a collection of internet protocol implementations.

Many of the protocols found in this package have been moved after the
package split in Twisted 2.0. This means you will get a C{DeprecationWarning}
if you try to import, e.g., L{twisted.protocols.http} notifying you
that it has been moved to L{twisted.web.http}.
