        The source part of the returned tuple must be the source of the
        template as unicode string or a ASCII bytestring.  The filename should
        be the name of the file on the filesystem if it was loaded from there,
        otherwise `None`.  The filename is used by python for the tracebacks
        if no loader extension is used.

        The last item in the tuple is the `uptodate` function.  If auto
        reloading is enabled it's always called to check if the template
        changed.  No arguments are passed so the function must store the
        old state somewhere (for example in a closure).  If it returns `False`
